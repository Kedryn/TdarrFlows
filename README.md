# TdarrFlows
Those are FLOWS i made for managing my media library.
I'm sharing this to help other Tdarr user, as an already useable flows or as a base to develop their own versions.
I'm also accepting questions and advices on optimize them.

Flows already have some basic comments on how it works.

I've also added a flow "UnversalTranscode" that uses new library variables to specify maxres for scaling and tune for animation, without the need to have different copies of the flow as the previous Flow.
